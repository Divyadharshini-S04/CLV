Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction
**Project Overview**

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric that helps businesses estimate the total revenue they can expect from a customer throughout their relationship.
This project builds a machine learning pipeline using the Online Retail dataset to predict CLV and segment customers into meaningful groups (Low, Medium, High value).

The goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing, customer retention, and revenue optimization.

**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python – Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning & feature engineering

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

XGBoost – Gradient boosting regression

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

**Steps in the Project**

Data Loading – Imported Online Retail dataset into Pandas.

Data Cleaning – Removed missing values & invalid records.

Feature Engineering – Created Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics & Average Order Value (AOV).

Model Training – Trained RandomForest and XGBoost regression models to predict CLV.

Model Evaluation – Evaluated with MAE (Mean Absolute Error) & RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Feature Importance – Used XGBoost to identify top factors influencing CLV.

Customer Segmentation – Classified customers into Low, Medium, High LTV categories.

Result Export – Saved predictions with customer IDs & segments to CSV.

**Key Insights**

High-value customers are few but contribute the most to revenue.

Medium-value customers can be nurtured with loyalty programs & cross-selling.

Low-value customers may be churn risks and need retention strategies.

**Future Improvements**

Incorporating customer behavior & demographic features.

Applying time-series forecasting for CLV over time.

Experimenting with deep learning models for better accuracy.
